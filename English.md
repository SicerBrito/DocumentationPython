# Introduction  
In the world of programming there are many branches such as web design, application development, artificial intelligence, computer security among many others. On this occasion we are going to see basic concepts that are repeated in the same or different ways in various programming languages. A programming language is a set of rules and symbols used to give instructions to a computer or computer system. These instructions allow programmers to communicate with machines and control their behavior in specific ways. Programming languages act as intermediaries between human language and machine language, which is the set of binary instructions understood by computers.

On this occasion we are going to use a programming language called Python which is a general purpose language and is well known and easy to learn due to its structure that is easy to read. What do I mean by this? When I refer to a general purpose language, I mean that the programming language is used for many tasks such as the aforementioned web design, script development, game development, among others.

# Download Windows

To use a programming language and be able to execute it, it is first of all necessary to install it. To install Python we are going to access this link  
    https://www.python.org/  
We went to downloads and downloaded version 3.11.5, once the file was downloaded, we executed it so that it is installed in our operating system.

# Download linux

 - ### Step 1: Open the Terminal
    Open the terminal on your Linux system. You can search for "Terminal" in the applications menu or use a keyboard shortcut like Ctrl + Alt + T.

 - ### Step 2: Update the packages
    It is good practice to update repositories and packages before installing new programs. Run the following commands in the terminal:

        sudo apt update
        sudo apt upgrade

 - ### Step 3: Install Python
    Python is usually already pre-installed on many Linux distributions. However, you may want to install the latest version or make sure it is installed. To install Python 3, run:

    For Debian-based systems (such as Ubuntu):

        sudo apt install python3

 - ### Step 4: Verify the installation
    After the installation, verify that Python has been installed correctly by running the following command in the terminal:

        python3 --version

    This should display the version of Python installed on your system.
